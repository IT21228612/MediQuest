In the field of healthcare, securing access to vital medicines remains a fundamental aspect of public health. Getting prescribed medicines on time can significantly impact one's well-being. This project takes on a vital issue: how to make finding and obtaining prescribed medicines easier.
Medicines are essential for maintaining health, and timely access is crucial. Delays can affect the effectiveness of treatments, the management of chronic illnesses, and even emergency care. However, many people face difficulties when trying to locate and purchase the medicines they need. The current economic crisis in Sri Lanka and the countryâ€™s healthcare system sometimes makes it hard to find specific medicines. People struggle to discover pharmacies with the right medicines, deal with uncertainty about availability, and find alternatives when needed.
The main goal of this project is to create a mobile app that addresses these challenges. This app is designed to simplify the process of finding and acquiring medicines, ensuring people can access what they need quickly. The app is for everyone who needs prescription medications, from young adults with common health issues to elderly individuals managing chronic conditions. It's a user-friendly solution that can benefit people from various age groups and backgrounds.
